in life we are allowed to change our minds.
This place is so CONGESTED and FRUSTRATING.
You had to know it would be a success!???  Rent the whole building out!?  A claustrophobic maze getting in and out of here..  want a coffee/espresso upstairs; FORGET about it; I've been 8 times; only twice was the line under a dozen people, it's good but the line is too long.  Some of the worst cashiers at pizza line; chatting, hugging, orders wrong... I don't think I like this place anymore."
2,"They have never let me down. Their tacos has consistently been the best I've had in Toronto. Always fresh, always delicious. I always bring visitors to this joint because it's such a good reflection of the food, culture, environment of Toronto. 

Tried their beef cheeks for the first time and my goodness, I don't know why it took me so long! It was absolutely heavenly. Definitely recommend!"
2,"Visit: Saturday inthe 5 o'clock hour 

Atmosphere: small shop,minimal seating only one uneven bench and only uneven table lol busy but organized line moves at a decent pace 

Food: I got 2 tacos $6 each, all tacos are the same price. I got the fried haddock and the beef... the beef was so tender and literally melted in my mouth the sauce that they but on it paired well with it. The haddock wow what a large portion the fillet was bigger than my tortilla that never happens the tartar sauce was yummy and went great with the diced tomatoes. Both tacos were hot temperature wise and served fresh

I would recommend and I will go back next time I'm in the area to try the other combinations"
2,"I would say La Carnita has one of the best tacos around this area ! There are many selections of tacos and two of my favourite ones are the carne asada and the spicy chorizo. The lunch special have never failed to delight me! The deal is $16.99 + tax for two tacos, one appetizer and one dessert which ends up to be a very good deal ! I would say my favourite appetizer to get is the Mexican corn as it has this creamy cheese coated on top of a roasted sweet corn. Definitely a hot spot to come and try!"
1,"Friendly service and accommodated a baby no problem on busy Sunday evening.

I tried 3 types of tacos and the standout was the fish taco for me. I absolutely loved my margarita with the star anise spice in it. Must try!
The calamari was pretty weak, very small portions and fried batter falling off.

I would return to try a burrito, they looked massive."
1,"A few points:

We got:

-grilled fish tacos 
-bean/cheese quesadilla 
-chicken quesadilla 
-beef tacos
-beef burrito 
-fried plantain 
-churro
-4 beers/$10 Sunday deal

3 stars because the portions are on the small side for what you pay. One hungry person will need at least two orders of tacos plus a side to fill them up. Service was ok but seemed a bit disinterested. 

The churro was very very good. I recommend for desert. That was probably the dish that stood out the most. 

The venue itself is nicely designed and a cool hangout spot. I'm happy to have a place like this in the neighbourhood especially because there are not a ton of sit down Mexican restaurants in the east end. They definitely fill a niche. Food is fine but nothing to write home about. Worth a try but it won't knock you off your feet. You will be annoyed by the lack of parking but not much one can do about that."
2,"My go to Mexican eat-in restaurant. Nice and cozy. 

We ordered the following:
1. Carne Asada Platter. 8/10. Plate was a good portion for one person, definitely if you are hungry. Comes with marinated grilled beef topped with a jalepeno, side of grilled onion, beans, guac & 5 corn tortillas. The beef, I wish was cooked a bit more rare. It was a bit tough to cut through. 

2.  TACOS: 
- Baja fish Taco 10/10. The fish was nicely fried in a batter. My fave out of all the tacos tried.
- Tacos de Chorizo 10/10. The spicy chopped sausage was bomb!
- Tacos de Tinga 8/10. Flavour was a bit off for me. The chicken was nicely cooked though.

3. Alcohol - Mangonada - 10/10. Absolutely delicious!!

Service was great. Food was served nice and hot. Will be coming back! :)"
1,"I've been to Mexitaco a couple of times now and they've been good enough. The servers are friendly but not as attentive as I'd like, make sure to really confirm what you've ordered to ensure nothing has been missed and if something doesn't arrive soon, check with your server because it probably wasn't punched in. The atmosphere is fun but small, and busy on weekends, so make reservations if you have a group. 

The nachos with added guacamole is good but don't expect much cheese happening with these, it's mostly tomatoes, onions, and sour cream; the added guacamole really helps, but wish their guacamole was thicker because it's very slurry like.

The elote was not good here. It didn't look or taste like it was actually grilled, plus the mayonnaise and shredded cheese combination grossed me out. I've tried other Mexican style street corn that are much better.

Out of the tacos I've tried, the baja fish is my favourite, followed by the carne asada. I find their tacos are on the drier side so make sure to really use the supplied limes, salsa, and hot sauce provided after you order. I would not recommend the baja calamari taco, it was 3 sad tiny battered calamari rings (like the sad frozen ones) that were also chewy and flavourless. 

The frozen margarita with added Coronita was unexpectedly salty, so I would not recommend. Try their Pina Colada instead - can be a hit or miss.

We've tried other things on the menu that are okay but this is what we will typically order every time and basically what not to order for next time."
1,"I give this place 3.5 stars.

This little neighbourhood hole-in-the-wall is one major black west of Chinatown proper. I like the industrial minimalist decor and the open-concept kitchen - which means you can hear the comforting sounds of food being prepared and cooked.

The menu is simple - not the 10-page ones you get at the authentic Chinese restaurants like Asian Legend. It seems they've decided just to focus on the crowd-pleaser items.

We ordered the chilli fish and the beef noodle soup. Both dishes came to the table piping hot. The chilli fish is a medium-sized plate of lightly battered, small fish fillets with a nice kick - I give it 4 stars. The beef noodle soup is a big bowl filled with (mostly) tender pieces beef, thick spaghetti-like noodles, what looked like bak choy and broth that also has a kick - I give it 3.5 stars.

The young wait staff seem eager - which is good. (Perhaps some of the more authentic Chinese restaurants like Kwan - at Yonge-St. Clair -  should have some of their waiters get pointers from Chop Chop.)

I would go back for the chilli fish."
2,"If there are three words that will get me into almost any dining establishment it is this ""Al Pastor Tacos"".

If nothing else, the value is great! Five tacos for ~$10 CAD is awesome. Maybe it's not that unusual, but a newcomer is allowed a little wiggle room, right?

Anyways, I ordered the Al Pastor Tacos (surprise surprise), and the Jamaica. While the tacos were small, this kept them from falling apart, and 5 was more than enough to fill me up, but not have me loosening my belt. 

The Jamaica kind of reminded me of homemade fruit compote. Not too sweet, and just the right amount of tart. Overall, the flavours were extremely well balanced. Due to the complexity of them, though, I'd say it was borderline refreshing. Though thesis not a bad thing. 

The tacos didn't shy away from their authenticity. Nothing fancy-shmancy, just the traditional protein, onion, cilantro, and the pineapple that comes with Al Pastor. The flavours were well balanced, without too much of one or another flavour. 

However, my gripe is that the pork was rather dry. They did provide two hot sauces, and a lime, and to be fair, they helped, but didn't solve the underlying problem. Furthermore, they lacked anything (this is where sauces and general moisture come in) to help tie the different flavours together.

Speaking of hot sauces: the red one was okay, and rather spicy. The green one though is rather undeveloped. I hate to say it, but it almost tastes like when I tried to make hot sauce by blending jalape√±os and vinegar. 

The location has a cool vibe, and the service was very polite."
2,"I came here on a bustling evening 30 mins before close(we hadn't realized they closed earlier than most restaurants in Korea town), however we weren't the last to walk through the doors. 

Since the restaurant is on the smaller side, we had to wait about 20 minutes before being seated. Even though they were close to closing, they didn't rush us at all.

The atmosphere is very cozy, laidback yet still lively. The service was great, our server was super outgoing and humorous which is nice after a long day at work. Food is very affordable, they have many options but not too many it becomes overwhelming. 


I ordered the chorizo and the pork soft taco, and all I can say is it brought me back to my trip in Mexico. The meat was juicy and the toppings were fresh. I also ordered the rice with cheese, although simple was great. 
We ordered plantains as well, and that was the icing on the cake to us. Instantly made me want to go back to Mexico. 

Would definitely come back, just wish they were open a little later."
2,"After hearing so much good things about this taco spot in the Annex Food Hall, I couldn't wait to try their take-home TACO KITS!!

How to order: 
-online through the tacokittoronto.com website for pick-up or delivery 
-Tuesday DELIVERY IS FREE if you pre-order by the previous Sunday

The Taco kits:
Each kit is only $20-$25 & easily feeds 1-2 people! I tried their Yucatan chicken & Barbacoa Beef. Each came with their own super fresh chopped up toppings and baggie of corn tortillas. I reheated the meat by microwaving in time intervals and the tortillas were warmed on a stovetop pan with a bit of oil.

YUCATAN CHICKEN (4.5/5) - saucey and the complex spices that marinated the juicy chicken was perfection. Paired with pickled radish & cheese made the flavours pop even more.

BARBACOA BEEF (5/5) - THE JUICIEST shreds of flavourful beef. I absolutely loved the freshness that a sprinkle of onions, cilantro & lime did to it. And I can't forget about that creamy avocado spread! 

Overall:
I'm honestly so surprised at how generous they were with their ingredients and the amazingly JUICY & FLAVOUR-PACKED meats. These taco kits are easy, fresh, and a fun way to do take-out. Definitely recommend giving El Nahual a try for your next Taco Tuesday!"
1,"The food was enjoyable, the service was friendly, and the price was reasonable.

However, though my party of four were the only ones in the restaurant aside from another couple, it took very long for our food to come out. I can't imagine how long it would take if it was a full house.  Based on other reviews here, this seems like an ongoing problem at Agio.

The decor is also a mismatch to what they're trying to be... a restaurant that serves high end Italian cuisine. It's basically a hole in the wall here, well below average in all aspects (floor, tables, decor, walls, washrooms, etc)"
1,"Delicious tacos, horrible sangria. 

Campechano and Seven Lions are the only two ""authentic"" tacos I've had in Toronto, as compared to tacos you can get in the US, particularly as you get close to the Mexican border. At $6-$8 each, they're not cheap, and you'll need between 2-4 to fill you up. 

Avoid the sangria - one of the worst I've had in Toronto."
2,"Mexican food done right! 

The meat was cooked so well, juicy and flavourful. The caramelized onions added another dimension of great flavour.  We also got guac and chips for $4.50 very good as well. 

To those who complain about waiting for food.. you are only waiting because they are making it fresh. It's not like chipotle where it sits there for what could be hours.

Good prices, good food!"
2,"Delicious, unpretentious tacos in a hidden gem of a restaurant. 

Ended up here after reading positive Yelp reviews. The tacos are delicious, well-balanced and inexpensive for the serving size. You're much better coming here for food alone, vs. going to the majority of Mexican tapas places in the city that are more for the ambience. 

Also, I ended up talking to some of the employees and I asked them about the name. It's derived from when Donald Trump accused Mexicans of being rapists, criminals, etc- a bunch of ""bad hombres"". Good on Good Hombres for putting some positive vibes out into the world.  

Please note, there is only bar seating here so it's not great for groups. More for quick eats."
2,"Great food.   Very relaxing environment.  Price was very good as well.   
Really enjoyed the visit.  Service was super fast.  
Recommended."
0,"This was my second time dining at this establishment, but mark my words it is the last! While eating an order of noodles I was splitting with my gf I came across a COCKROACH!!!!!  

When I confronted the owner he looked down at my plate and saw the roach and quickly took my plate and dashed to the kitchen before I had a chance to take a photo.

The only funny and bewildering part to this is that a group of people standing behind me waiting to be seated saw what had happened and witnessed the roach in my noodles and still decided to stay and dine !!!!

FAIR WARNING TO ALL, DO NOT EAT HERE!!! COCKROACHES ARE ALSO DINING AMONG YOU!!!"
2,"A decent taco option on a very busy stretch of Queen West. Tacos are 3.50 or combination of three for $11. They let you mix and match from the regular which I like. My friend recommended the beef brisket which was quite good. I also enjoyed the pollo and the beer but the carnitas was a bit dried out. Service was also a bit slow as the small kitchen was slammed with delivery orders. 

Overall I liked the place and would go here again. It does not beat out some of favourites on St Clair or in Kensington. Also they need some El Pastor!

3.75"
2,"Absolutely delicious! Went with a friend for lunch at sat on their cute and petite outdoor seating. Service was fast and friendly, the food was delicious and extremely fairly priced, and filled my friend and I both up. Be aware that any bill under $10 total needs to be cash- but anything over that they accept credit/debit. Tacos were delicious street style tacos, came out fast and tasty! Guacamole was about average, but still tasty. Would definitely come again sometime!"
2,"An unassuming little spot in a strip mall known for some great food, and this Mexician restaurant is right at home with its neighbors. 

We had the chorizo burrito, pulled pork chimichanga, and a horacha to wash it all down. The burrito came wrapped simply but was toasted to perfection and carried the perfect balance of meat, rice, beans and veggies. It was absolutely delicious and we wolfed it down even before the second dish showed up. I bit into the pulled pork chimichanga and wondered what was so impossibly creamy..... and I turned out to be the melt in the mouth pulled pork. So delicious.

Excellent service and friendly staff. They found it amusing that I was so happy to get my goblet of horchata and promptly got us everything we needed to enjoy our meal. A lovely neighbourhood gem."
1,"Not bad but quality control should be supervised.

We order probably once a month and food quality is a hit or miss.

Like today, broccoli was old. 

Some time the beef noodles, the beef is tough."
0,Horrible service. I used Yelp waitlist feature and arrived on time. We stood by the door for 20 minutes and nobody bothered to check on us. All the servers were chatting amongst themselves. No single exchange of words at all with their customers.
1,"I was very excited about trying Quetzal. Upon arrival the ambiance was great, with candlelit tables and a curved ceiling, like being inside of a ship. The bar seating was inviting and the drinks menu was inventive and cocktails were superior with great notes for sipping.

For the food we did the tasting menu, since there were many unique dishes that we wanted to try. The sea bream and scallop ceviche was underwhelming, with the scallops being were quite small and not fresh tasting. The other sushi grade fish - the kanpchi tiradito - was good in comparison. The thin crispy Masa round was similar to a taco pizza, and a fun app to share. 

Next up, the kale salad was tasty and served with the full stems. The bone marrow came with two large bones but didn't seem to have enough flavour cooked into it. Lastly, the skirt steak and 18oz rib eye were served. We were never asked how we liked it cooked when ordering, but we received medium rare which worked out to our tastes. 

Overall, great value for a lot of food and high quality ingredient based dishes, but nothing stood out at the end of the night. I was hoping for a little more bite. 

It's a beautiful restaurant otherwise, and maybe I'm just not the right fit for palette."
2,This place is a little gem. The food here is delicious. I would say the prices are quite fair for authentic Mexican cuisine. I found it to be very flavourful. The owner of the restaurant is also very friendly.
2,Tacos were very tasty and authentic. Reminded me of the street vendor tacos in got in Cabo.
1,"We made resos for a Thursday night. Boy was this place packed! I liked the ambiance but felt like it was too noisy. I liked how it was dimly lit. 
I ordered the duck ravioli. Portion size seemed small. Sauce was good but I felt like it was missing something salty! 
My friend ordered the spicy sausage pasta which was tasty as well. She said it was al dente and the pieces of meat were good. It wasn't too salty or saucy.  
The complimentary bread was mediocre. It was cold and came in a folded paper basket. A small bowl of olive oil was hidden underneath. The olive oil was delishhh though! 
Overall it was alright. Prices are reasonable for the quality. I'm not sure if I'd go back again though!"
2,"Pros:
1. The shrimp & cheese taco (only 1 taco...) is delicious.
2. The taco finishes with a layer of cheese and pickled onion, quite guilty :) 
3. And a layer of meat at the bottom!

Cons:
1.long lineup 
2. $2 higher than other places in Kensington Market."
1,"Great spot if you wanna get some quick tacos or burritos.

There was a huge variety of options to order and al for a fair price however there was a huge lack of flavour in anything you ate until you added sauces from their sauce bar(which was great). I felt like I was getting grilled vegetables flavoured with salt and wrapped in a tortilla. 

My stars are really going towards the tomatillo sauce which really saved the day."
2,"Ended up going back today and buying tortillas for the first time from the store.

This deserves another 5/5 stars - it absolutely takes a homemade taco night to the next level. For just $10, we were given about 45 tortillas. It is portioned by weight, but it is generally about 20 - 24 tortillas for $5

The tortillas were made to order as soon as I walked in, and it only took about three minutes to make all of them.

Good Hombres is a great local business, so if you're even doing a homemade taco night, show them some love and grab some tortillas. It's cheaper than any grocery store, and the quality is substantially better

Enjoy!

5/5 Stars"
2,"I always wanted to go here coz it's near Chris' jerk. Hole in the wall about 14 seats and family owned. Have to order at the cashier then take your seat. There was about 10 customers including me and my wife. But there was a lot of pick up and skip the dishes coming thru. We ordered Chorinachos and sizzling fajitas. Once we got the Chorinachos we decided to take the fajitas home. It was a good amount of nachos and meat and it was delicious. We had the fajitas for dinner and it was amazing for take out. The take out container is so nice not ur average container everything separated. The service was very friendly and didn't wait too long. Can't wait to go back and try different dishes, pretty much wanna eat all what's in the menu. I can't emphasize enough how friendly the service was."
0,"We came here today to have her usual Sunday family dinner. However, we found her self with a very poor service, unfriendly waiter, cold food and very plain flavors. The place is very cozy, Nevertheless I would not recommend this place."
1,"This restaurant was fantastic dealing with some menu modifications that allergies required. Usually there is pushback from the kitchen but not this place. For that we are grateful. 

The modified meal was good, well cooked and an ok all round meal. The pasta in both meals was properly cooked and fresh. The veal however, not as good. It had large sections of charred burnt meat and was quite dry. 

Overall, the service was great, food...mediocre."
1,"A girlfriend took me here for my birthday celebration. Loved the ambience here, and we were lucky enough to be seated on the upper deck patio. Beautiful space - the deck was covered by a huge tree decorated by fairy lights. This made it feel like we were in a completely differently place altogether, away from the hustle and bustle of Downtown Toronto. 

The room next to the upper deck had a family celebrating a birthday; and there was a lady playing the accordion for them. Almost felt like we were in Italy!

I'm giving this restaurant a 3 stars rating solely because of the food. I had the Zuppa Di Pesce, which I asked the sauce to be replaced with the ros√© sauce.  I wasn't very impressed with the pasta considering the price. Both in taste and in the seafood quality. 

Service at this restaurant was great - we casually brought up that it was my birthday and they brought a complimentary tiramisu as a surprise! So wonderful! 

I would certainly come back here for drinks/appetizer considering how amazing the space is!"
1,"Went there because craving for dumplings and saw good reviews online. Their shop is a bit old style but that isn't a matter.

Service: Their understandings of English is really low. I know they're Asian but still communication is key especially running a business. Realized most asian restaurants nowadays required customers to write on a paper for ordering

Food: Food was delicious! Handmade and freshly made to order. Like the chewiness of the noodles and the thinness of the dumplings.

However, they gave me 11 dumplings rather than a dozen. I didn't give a tip because of the poor communication and missing food but they complained about that :/"
1,"Don't expect a Chipotle/Taco Bell type place!

Parking:  There is drive-thru parking for this plaza, but lot was full of deep potholes.  It's best to park on Macdonald Ave.  It's a small residential street, just north of Lawrence.

Restaurant itself is SMALL.  There are 4 tables and a counter with a few stools.  Restaurant opens early for Desayunos.

I believe this restaurant specialises in Michoacan food, the birthplace of canitas, low and slow cooked meats, and stews such as pozole.  Prices for specialty items were on the ""higher end"", e.g. pozole was $15 and a Michoacano Burrito (snout-to-tail, slow cooked pork), $15.  There wasn't much sauce in the burrito itself, no rice, just meat.  It was nicely cooked, but quite porkie.

Overall, the tastes are quite different than, let's say, your typical taco places downtown.  It's more about regional cooking.

Area seems a bit rough, so some of the prices did surprise me.  Ok to try, but I wouldn't drive out of my way (esp at night) to head there!"
0,"The decor is nice and the atmosphere feels right, but this place lacked a bit of service attention. 

We dropped by for a quick bite as we love Mexican food. We ended up ordering the fajitas for two. It was a large portion of meat (we got chicken and chorizo mix) but there were only 5 (five) tiny tortillas... that didn't make sense to me. 2 or us, lots of meat, but very few tortillas...we asked and we had to pay to get more, which I thought was not reasonable. I didn't get more cause I'm cheap. Also, we got a tiny container of sour cream. 

Overall it felt like they offered very little in terms of condiments. 
I waited a good 5-10 minutes to get more napkins and some hot sauce (Something good and spicy) but no luck. I ended up getting up and walking to the front to ask for it. Overall the service wasn't great. 
The fajitas were good but nothing out of this world. The selection of Mexican beers was also limited. 
We will have to keep looking for the ultimate Mexican Food place!"
2,"My family and I were looking for a place that had both meat and vegan tacos. This place kept coming up for us so we checked it out. 

I called the Queen St. location and they kindly advised us to check out the Bloor St. location because they were full. With the Bloor St. location being the closest to us, we took their advise. 

Upon arrival, there were only a few people there and a nice booth available for us. We ordered at the front and took our seat. the cashier with the long brown hair and tattoos on her arm was so sweet and friendly. 

She served us our drinks immediately (they have a nice selection of soft drinks and alcoholic drinks) and just to say, their prices were very fair for the amount of food we got. 

I got the vegan chorizo and it was delicious! The rice and beans made me feel like I was in Mexico, truly authentic and tasty! Full of flavour! 

Everyone else loves their tacos and we left very satisfied! They definitely work as a team at this location and it was nice to see!
Friendly, Tasty, Authentic and Vegan Options made our Friday night a great one! 

Gracias!"
0,"Without question the worst cashew nut chicken I ever unfortunately ordered...
Smaller than most restaurants portions, to top it off; $18.01 for garbage food.
There are many WRONGS in this world; a bad meal is pretty low in the grand scheme of things/life.  BUT; a garbage meal is still a garbage meal.  Staff looked miserable, absolutely unpleasant.  I don't need an ass-kissing or TLC at a fast food Chinese restaurant, this was depressing.  Waste of money, waste of time."
2,"My sister and I came here during March break. We loved it honestly. Good food, damn good music, chill vibes, great service. I'm one of those people that likes to ask what's good, and their food and drink recommendations were spot on. We loved it so much we even came back again on our trip! Servers were cool as hell and made us feel very welcome!"
2,"Note:  This restaurant is more for a quick bite / take-out.  Although I really wouldn't recommend that you wait too long as I don't think the tacos will taste as good!

Tacos appear to be small, but they really pack a punch in terms of taste!  I ordered 3 tacos/$12:  Fish, Yucatan Chicken, & Al Pastor.  All of them tasted distinct, with different toppings, and were visually appealing as well.  They looked as though pride was taken in the presentation of the tacos!  Very good and I was actually full after eating them.  Initially, I was doubtful when I saw how petit they were.  :)

Parking:  ""Restaurant"" is located on the smaller, north side of Keele Street.  There is PAID angled parking just in front/across the street.  During my visit, there were plenty of street parking (paid) on Eglinton itself.  If you're eastbound on Eglinton Ave W, it can be tricky to turn left onto this small street as the street is very busy / undergoing construction.  

Atmosphere:  El Nahual is quite small.  There is only counter seating for 8-10ppl.  Stools are solid, but they look like crates turned on their side, so they're not very comfortable.  Again, this is why I said that I don't think this place is intended for dining in for an extended period of time.

It was really hot out when I came in and they kept the doors open.  It wasn't super uncomfortable, but it definitely will be if it was more humid.

Service:  Girl at the counter was very friendly and nice.  Note that the food does take a while, so DO NOT come here if you need to be in/out.  After I ordered, the girl said that tacos would take 15-20mins and that was pretty accurate.

I would definitely come back to try out other tacos &/or even get a burrito, but for now, only if I was in the area as it's quite congested and Eglinton is really messed up. 

Free chips w/ creamy guac with Yelp check-in!"
0,"If I was able to give 0 stars, I would. This is probably the worst restaurant I've eaten at. 

We ordered 5 dishes, 4 of which were completely inedible.
- Traditional pancake: This was our first dish and was fairly tasty. No complaints here. This was the only redeeming part of the experience.
- Green beans with minced meat: It was too salty and too oily. 
- Kungpow shrimp: This is absurdly greasy and spicy which left our tongues numb. 
- Fried rice with pineapple and seafood: In contrast to the previous two dishes that were over-spiced, this was tasteless and (surprise surprise) oily as heck. 
- Lobster with ginger and scallion: This was the most pathetic dish of them all. We were served either a baby lobster that had not yet developed any meat, or they somehow threw out half of the lobster before plating it. On top of this, it did not taste fresh.

Sometimes terrible food can be saved by good service. Nope, not today unfortunately. The waiters were amateur (pleasant, and well-meaning but did not know what they were doing). They gave us a dirty fork, and when we alerted them to it, they took it away then brought it back and said ""we washed it for you"". 

You might look at my profile picture and judge me for being a clueless white guy. I went with a group of 3 other Chinese people who know food well, and we were all appalled at how this restaurant is even open for business."
0,"This place has been on my list of must-try restaurants in the Yonge-Eg area for quite some time (mostly because of all the high Yelp reviews). However, I was pretty disappointed with my experience. Cleanliness is a really big deal to me, and the restaurant did not feel very clean. There were a LOT of flies buzzing around my table, to the point that I had to swat my hand in between every single bite and was afraid one would fly into my mouth (ew!). The bread was cold, and the pasta was mediocre and at a higher price point. The waiter could see me constantly waving my hand to get the flies out of my face and made no comment. I was not impressed."
0,"Almost gave it two stars (read to find out more) but the one thing I can't get over is serving an alcoholic drink to someone who specified ""virgin"", when you delivered it to the table she checked again that it was ""virgin"", you agree verbally it had no alcohol, she tries some, tastes alcohol and then you go -- ""Oooh actually this one is the virgin"".  Sure, if she was pregnant or on medication or driving, maybe the sip of alcohol wouldn't be *that* big a deal.  But if she was recovering alcoholic, that one sip could literally change her life, and it's up to you as a business to be honest and knowledgeable about what you're serving.

Things that were terrible:
- we had a reservation, they called us to confirm it was for 700 pm, show up, they say oops we thought 730 pm, they literally have to move people from their seats to accommodate us
- during the 45 minute wait for all this to take place, they took drink orders from us multiple times, but never served us drinks
- they dropped an entire plate of steaming hot chicken fajitas on the ground, it splashed boiling sauce all over people, and their clothes as well
- when i went over to the owner at this point to say - now that we are covered in fajita sauce - can we please have the drinks we keep trying to order? she made a HUGE stink about it, just immediately responded, ""We didn't do any of this on purpose, do you understand? We are doing our best"" and then going to every member of my party reiterating that, as though I had done some rude injustice to her, it was super embarrassing and unprofessional
- drinks still took an extra hour and they weren't good
- they served the birthday girl fajitas with no tortillas or sides, just the meat (she didn't ask for that modification)
- the food was so awful my poor fiance actually sent his BACK -- and this is a guy who complains about NOTHING
- bills took over an hour after asking MULTIPLE times
- the place was so warm they had to keep opening the front door to let in cool air

It almost got 2 stars because they did pay the dry cleaning bill for the jacket that was covered in fajitas sauce, but honestly, I can't forgive the alcohol incident.  This whole experience was stressful and awful. I have no idea why they took our reservation (none of us had been there before), we were clearly too big a group for them at 700 (or 730..or 800...depends who you ask) on a Saturday!"
2,"Not too many gooooooood mexican joints in town, but this is a must try spot! I had the beef, pork, chkn and veggie tacos. All were very well seasoned, marinated, and the flavours come together so nicely! Of the tacos i had, one was a bit on the stale side, thats why it lost a star..but service was great! Staff were all very cheerful and friendly despite how busy it was. Keep it up guys!"
1,"We decided to drop by on a late Saturday night, the place was busy but we were lucky to wait only 15 minutes. We ordered the Street Corn, Beer Battered Haddock Tacos, Crispy General Tao Tacos, BBQ Beef Brisket Taco and Pork Shoulder Burrito. 

The Street Corn came out - and was absolutely delicious! The cream sauce on top was the perfect sauce for it. 
When the tacos came out, the Crispy General Tao Taco's sauce seemed to have drenched all the other ones as well, so the tacos were very soggy, and didnt leave much of an impression. Out of the three the Haddock was definitely the best.  Lastly, we the burrito came out, and that was delicious. The salsa, the rice, and meat were so tender it came together perfectly. Overall we enjoyed our dinner at Chula, and would probably come back to check it out in the summer on their patio. We found the indoor restaurant to be a bit cramped (especially the front of the house)."
1,"Relatively new noodle spot that opened up downtown just at Bay and Dundas. Came by with a few coworkers for lunch and the consensus was that it was okay. 

Even though Artisan plus was packed when we arrived. We were lucky and was able to get seated fairly quickly for a party of 6. 

We were seated on the high top right in front of the kitchen and got to witness the staff in action. It still amazes me how efficient the kitchen works, it's a well oiled machine. 

I ordered the appetizer trio, pork bun, and clam mashi. The appetizer trio was a combo of enoki, bean curd, and tripe. Of the 3 the tripe stood out the most. The bean curd and enoki mushroom were okay at best. The trio comes with dipping sauce that tasted very similar to a peanut sauce. 

The pork bun was shared among the group and we found that although the pork was really flavourful and moist, the bun itself was a tad on the dry side. Not the good kind either. It's worth a try but I wouldn't be ordering this again if I visited again. 

The clam mashi was amazing! I've gotta say I could have done with without the other two items on the menu but the clam mashi is a must. Be warned, it's a little spicy. I would say out of 10, would be about a 7 on my scale. Not to the point where the heat was unbearable and unenjoyable. It definitely lingers and I found myself going through water pretty quickly. The clams were declines in the dish and there was quite a few in there to enjoy. This was my first time having mashi and I'm now a big fan of that."
1,"Went here with my friends and family. I liked the spice side fillings and their lobster tacos was good I heard. I had the veggie enchiladas and was alright. Even the veggie tostadas was good. However, I feel the food was expensive for the food quality.
We got the 
Nachos  - small but good
Guacamole and chips - good needed some spice 
Chicken wings - so so 
Veggie enchiladas - was so so 
Veggie burrito - good 
Veggie tostados - good
Shrimp enchiladas - was so so 
Lobster tacos - very good 
Fish tacos - very good 
Pork tacos - was so so"
0,"I really want to like this place. I really do. I've gone here since 2013, and then I tell myself never again, but it's so close and convenient, etc. But yeah, everytime I go I wonder why it's rated so high by everyone else.

First, banh mi shouldn't take forever to make. Go to any Vietnamese place and the person behind the counter will literally slap together a sandwich in a matter of minutes. They have a team of people working here and it still takes longer somehow.

Second, the banh mi itself (i.e., the bread) doesn't taste right. It's not crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. As for the rest of the sandwich, there's something about it that lacks authenticity. Atop of this, it's way pricier than it should be."
2,"I'm a long-term fan of Playa Cabana restaurants, and this one is my favourite. The restaurant is quite small, so it's best to make reservation ahead of time. Everything from their ceviche, guacamole, poblano-corn crab cakes, and avocado & black beans salad, to tacos and burritos are some of the best I've tried in the GTA. My go-to dishes are the lobster tacos and side avocado & black beans salad. The lobster tacos come in crunchy hard shells filled with large, tender pieces of lobster meat, and queso cheese."
0,"I have been here in three years and the quality has definitely come down.

We ordered the chicken fried rice which had no carrots or peas just rice and chicken. It tasted ok.

The sesame chicken was way too sweet and tasted like a chicken Tim bit.

The dim sum was below average for the price. There are definitely better and cheaper options. I a long time customer will not be returning."
2,"Came to try this place for a chill birthday dinner- I would say it was worth the long wait on a Saturday. All the dishes are well seasoned and thought out, not to mention the guacamole portion was well worth paid for! However, I would highly recommend the curry fish- perfect for those who enjoy spicy food."
0,"This restaurant is really for the experience. With such a lovely ambience and outstanding service from all staff, the food did not meet up to par with what you may expect.

For starters the food is on the higher price end, and smaller quantities. Although, it is all homemade pasta!! 

I've had homemade pasta before so I had high standards walking in.. I was so excited to try the Gnocchi because well, I LOVE Gnocchi. 

However, I was disappointed. The pasta itself was quite soft and seemed soggy with the red sauce altogether. There was no 'bite' to it, more of a 'mush'. I did not enjoy my meal and that left a significant impression on my take of what the rest of the entrees may be like. 

Note: Calamari & Earl Grey tea were delicious!"
1,"Donatello's has a great decor and great atmosphere. The staff were extraordinarily attentive and friendly. The cost/performance ratio of the food is however a little wanting. I had the mussels which was quite tasty but a bit skimpy for the price. The veal marsala was pretty average at best. The other notable dish was the egg plant salad which is quite imaginative with a layer of pineapple in the middle. All in all, a pleasant experience but would not rush back."
0,"This was the worst $32 I ever spent ... 
soggy & flavourless. Was very excited to try this place but I don't think I will be returning or ordering again in the future. Disappointed :("
2,"My friend recommended this place. I was a bit skeptical at first, since I just went to San Diego not long ago and ate a lot of good tacos. I gave it a shot when my boyfriend and I passed by Kensington market. Although a bit iffy at the $6 price, we decided the line was a good indicator that the tacos were good.

This place is cash only, and we waited in line for 20 minutes or so. The line moves fairly quickly. We got the fish taco and one of the shrimp tacos - the fish taco was definitely the best I've had. The shrimp one was also good, but not as good as the fish taco.

Really wish we ordered more!"
1,"Not feeling it for the new fancy location.

Love the old location with old friendly staff than the new ones.  The price is more expensive, and the food is not as good.  The new staff didn't know about serving / dinner etiquette.  Serving both left and right side.  With the lower food quality and higher price tag / seemed more fancy environment will look for more.  The owner is still there and he has to work hard and busy himself by telling the new younger staff what needs to be done.

Really disappointing that the food was not as good as before (far from it)."
1,"Fairly average Chinese food but open late until 2:00 am with lots of seating. They are located a block or so from from Spadina on Dundas.

Their food seems pretty average to me except for their char siu (BBQ Pork) on rice that is my favorite. Everything else is ok but with the exception of great wok hei. If you're looking for a quick bite after a night out this place will do since they open until 2:00 am and has plenty of seating. Their menu is fairly intense about 500 items and with plenty of seating for a big group. 

The food comes out super fast piping hot. Service is ok just need to keep flagging someone down, their table turn over is quick that is the way they operate so don't expect stellar service but they aren't horrible either."
1,"Dim sum in the heart of Yorkville, honestly coming from Richmond Hill (read: right beside Markham!) I wasn't expecting much. I expected average, bland tasting classics like har gow (shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (steamed pork bites wrapped in wonton-like skin). We arrived as a table of 7 on a weekday and the place was fairly empty - understandable, dim sum usually is a longer meal not favoured for a workday lunch hour. We ordered a bit of everything and some of us were looking for specific items - everyone found what they were looking for! There were a decent variety and many classics on the menu - some that aren't often found even in Markham because they're complex to make and don't sell for high prices.

The highlights were the fritter wrapped in rice roll, the osmanthus cake, and the mini octopus in curry sauce. Often the rice rolls are squishy and lack texture, but this one was a good consistency that complemented the crunchy (not chewy!) dough fritter. The osmanthus cake came with a base layer of coconut milk, providing additional flavour and texture that agreed with the table's demands for desserts that're not too sweet but still *something*. We also ordered steamed sponge cake - it was soft and fluffy, steaming hot. The realization the sponge cake was steamed baffled some, and the softness and light flavour was well received. It could've had more of the signature taste, but it was a decent attempt at the classic.

Overall for the location I was pleasantly surprised, and prices were aligned to the area as well. Unfortunately from a dim sum in Toronto perspective, I didn't feel like it was anywhere close to great and it definitely wasn't worth the price paid. Service was good and accommodating to the non-Chinese speakers, but translations were odd and made it more difficult to understand what things were in some cases. I'll be back for team lunches looking for exotic options and a group feeling because we're all at a round table, but aside that I'll stick with my suburb options."
0,"Worst Chinese food ever. It's places like this that give Chinese food a bad name. Threw out 75% of our order. 

Ordered what I thought would be staple Cantonese dishes that any decent place would find hard to screw up. Well guess what, Ha Gow managed to do just that. The seafood fried noodles were capital B bland - would it have hurt them to put even one drop of soy sauce? They also used cheap shrimp and squid that had no flavour. We also ordered the fried shrimp with spicy salt. This is honestly the most basic Cantonese dish (equivalent to fries for a Canadian restaurant). Well what came were those cheap shrimps they used for the noodles but smothered in a thick batter (they looked like balls of grease). Each bite oozed with grease and didn't taste like shrimp at all.

The other dishes ordered were equally bad. Seafood dumpling (all it tasted of was MSG), steamed squid in ginger and onion (think rubber bands laced with MSG), and shrimp rolls (no flavour). The spinach & shrimp dumpling was the only thing decent item. 

Avoid, avoid, avoid."
0,"Nice staff
Simple interior
About $20 for king pao w rice; restaurants love to add $$$$ for the rice, they know it goes with rice, so charge more, seems unfair.
It is definitely hot. Felt like CRAP hour(s) later.
Hard on the stomach, I like hot, this was too greasy and doesn't sit well.
Did I mention 4 hrs later..
Not so good!
Bad aftertaste and guts are mad at me."
0,"Totally disappointing - everything is definitely on the over-seasoned/extremely salty side. Or totally BURNT! 

The chips we were served were totally burnt and we were told they were the batch of the day and there was nothing they can do about it. (Check pic)

The chips were followed by a totally burnt batch of corn- were not talking grill marks here, crust black corn. We were told that how it's severed (no it's not, we've been here before!). Is there no one to check what comes out of the kitchen??

To add insult to injury chewed on an avocado pit in the guacamole. 

Hosting and service were another issue. Extremely disappointing experience all in all. Fails at all basic hospitality and restaurant standard."
0,"I ordered a taco from here, the Monterrey Steak. So tiny, it fits in the palm of your hand. Taste was ok but I don't think it is worth $6-7."
1,"Cute family run restaurant in Chinatown.
Everything made fresh and speedy.
Food is okay. The restaurant is busy but not full."
1,"We went on a Friday night and the wait was 40 minutes, so we decided to explore the area near us until we received a text that our table was ready. They led us to our table only to find that people were still sitting there. It took them 15 minutes to figure out another table for us. When we finally sat down, we were given menus and the food here is not cheap at all. We decided to get some chips and salsa to share with 2 tacos each. The salsa came in a tiny container that was barely enough for one person. We waited another 45 minutes for the tacos for them to be cold."
0,"I took the advice of one of the reviewers on Yelp & I got the hybrid burrito.  Boy was I disappointed.  I thought the flavours were sooo bland & the burrito itself was rice heavy & lacked sufficient amount of meat. Seriously I didn't even want to finish it.

Also it seemed like (from the pics on here) that this was a take out place, but it's not.  It's all table service.  

I just think this restaurant did not hold a candle to restaurants in the same price range.  In other words, it was ridiculously over-priced for what you get.  The burrito alone was around $15."
1,"Location: poor atmosphere, looks like the cliche Chinese restaurant right out of a movie. No eye appeal whatsoever. 

Food: ordered the chicken fried rice and the beef with ginger and spring onions. Being used to eating foods flavored with haberno peppers, we had them make our dishes spicy. The rice was very flavorful and nicely spiced. The beef dish was ok, didn't really stand alone well but mixed with the rice It was good. The water cups looked really dingy, which I didn't drink out of it Bc of that reason. 

Overall: food was good, if you don't mind the appearance of the place, I'd say go for it."
1,"Although the surroundings of a cellar-like space was nice, the overall pricey but subpar food, elementary plating/plates, and clumsy service was a let down especially in the Yorkville area.

I ordered their fish special of the night: Swordfish with a Side Salad. It was expensive, but the portion was great and the fish cooked & seasoned well!  The side salad was very basic but fresh, thankfully I had asked for the dressing on the side...especially since we previously ordered the Fried Calamari appetizer that came with some VERY greasy side salads. We ended our meal with some desserts, I tried their creme br√ªl√©e, but for $9.95 it was a rip off since the ramekin wasn't fully filled and the custard texture felt a little too whipped. Also, a little ridiculous that they charged us for hot water."
0,"We were in the neighborhood and couldn't decide what to eat so we did what others would do in our situation which was to bust out our phones and go on Yelp for suggestions! Well Yelp led us to this place based on its high ratings but I'm sad to say that Yelp has failed me again.  This restaurant's dimsum quality was not good. The curry cuttlefish was very watery and bland, their chicken feet had a weird taste, their sui mai was okay but again kind of bland, their spare ribs was full of fat and the list goes on and on with negative things to say about their other dishes. None was good!

Service was okay but their debit machine was down and I didn't have cash on me and when I asked if they take e- transfers, they said no. So I had to drive out to a bank to get cash which was a bit of a pain but of well.

Definitely will not comes back to this one."
2,"Some might this this is crazy, but these tacos are better than Seven Lives. Calm down, I wasn't sure if it would live up to the hype either, but this place exceeded every expectation that I could have.

Hacienda is located on College Street, very close to Sneaky Dees, in a bit of a tucked away, inconspicuous location. The interior is fantastic and the atmosphere is authentic.

There are a lot of reviews that knock this place for service, but that's not really the point of this restaurant. It's a family run place where the focus is food and soccer (when it's on) if you need something, you may need to call the serve over yourself, but that's no big deal cocerning the food.

The tacos are the best I've had in the City. At three tacos for $12, it's hard to go wrong. After reading some of the previous reviews, the beef tongue was an obvious choice. I'm not too big in beef personallty, but the meat was so tender and almost melted.

Next was the chorizo taco. It was fantastic. The chorizo wasn't overly salty like in a lot of other Mexican restaurants, which made a huge difference. The flavor was deep and rich, and paired perfectly with the salsa.

Lastly was the carnitas. It's hard to make carnitas as good as Seven Lives, but wow, these were something else. The carnitas were tender, juicy, and perfectly crispy.

The corn tortillas were also made in-house and were fresh and delocious. The servers also bring two sauces to the table - one salsa verde (green salsa) and one hot sauce. Both were great but be careful with the hot sauce, it's a heavy hitter! 

Pro tip: get a Mexican Coke, it's amazing!

Hacienda is the best taco place is the City. Seven Lives is a close second, but Hacienda has them beat in terms of authenticity and flavor.

Put this place on your go-to list, it will it dissapoint.

5/5"
2,"Wow, the most intense tacos I've ever had! Don't go expecting to have a sit down meal and please do yourself a favour and don't go on a date here because you will get messy. I promise you it's all worth it.

Wait in line and order at the cash, wait for your tacos and hope there's a seat. We were there at 3pm on a Saturday and we managed to squeeze in at the bar table. You can always take out but I think dining there is also part of the experience. 

The tacos are massive! I thought 2 wouldn't be enough but it was more than enough. They also have many different hot sauces you can add. Never have I eaten tacos with a fork but trust me, these are very big and I had to eat half the inside before I was able to somewhat grab them.

I believe they're opening a larger location across the street, I think it's much needed to keep up with the demand!"
2,"I found this place after simply yelping tacos in the area. Wilbur had amazing reviews so we decided to walk to this place from the CN Tower. When we got there the line was out the door and around the corner so we knew it was a popping place. 

The highlight of this restaurant is the salsa bar. There was over 8 sauces ranging from mild to spicy. 

Elote 5/5
I LOVE elote! This dish came with two corn on the cobs that were generously smothered in cheese, sauce and greatness. 

Fish taco 5/5 
It was lightly battered with slaw on top and my boyfriend added the verde salsa on top. 

California burrito with steak 5/5
The portion was huge. It had great flavors and we added the haberno salsa on top. 

Grilled avocado taco 5/5
I love avocados so this taco was perfect. I added the ghost salsa on top and it was amazing. 

Each dish comes with a side of chips. Pricing is reasonable and there is plenty of choices on the menu."
1,"I came here for a birthday dinner on Saturday at 8pm. We were a party of 5 and didn't have a reservation so our wait time was around 1hr but only because a reservation was cancelled. If it wasn't, we probably would have waited closer to 2hrs. 
Every time I come to La Carnita, I always get the pollo frito taco but unfortunately they sold out :( I ended up getting the achiote chicken instead and I didn't read the description properly so completely overlooked the jalapeno salsa part. It was so spicy for me, I was tearing up but completely my fault for not reading the menu lol. 
The service was quick, we received our order of Mexican Corn shortly after we placed our order and our tacos came out just before we finished the corn. 

This location is a little cramped for my liking but the food quality is the same with all the other places. I've always enjoyed my dining experience at La Carnita. A reservation is strongly recommended though, otherwise you might have to wait over an hour like I did."
1,"For so many years, I have never visit Terroni.  Actually after dinner tonight I don't think there's an urgent need as everything was normal and on the pricey side.

Was looking at the mushroom pasta special for Monday and the cost was  31.  I asked the waiter what's the portion sIze and he told me 5 pieces.....really?!

OK I went with the grilled calamari for $18 and a side of rapini for $10 instead.  Well, the calamari was alright, I like the tomato arugula salad a lot underneath but the rapini wasn't good as it was super hard to chew.

My friends had the $170 steak combo which came with a salad and a plate of veggies and it tasted good.

So my verdict is 2.5 stars  round up to 3 here we don't have half star option for review.  Prob won't be back tbh."
1,Came here tonight for dinner tonight because of awesome experience last time.  It was pretty empty on a Wednesday evening.  The owners are really lovely and this is why I give it 3 stars.  The food is not what it was when I visited last. I really enjoy authentic Mexican food and unfortunately the food tonight lacked spice that I really enjoy.   The food was flavourful but not nearly as amazing as I remember.  I ordered my food spicy and they wasn't even the slightest tingle :(
0,"II really, really wanted to just love this place and sorry about the loooong review (i am normally not one to have such an extended view) BUT I made two mistakes today:

1) Cancelling my reservation at Playa Cabana ( the last 5:00 pm spot) to go to this restaurant (SMH)
2) The place is supposed to open at 5,like a dumbass I actually waited until 5:20 when they finally decided they felt like opening.

That kind of slackness will get your business shut down in Toronto, with sooooooooooo many good places to go and eat all within blocks who the hell is really gonna stick around and wait for places to open past the time they should be??? ....ohhhhhhhhh the regret folks.   

When I walked in ,there were only two other people seated ( who also decided to sit outside and wait saw them earlier)..hmm wonder if they too had regret, but anyways onto the experience. Walked in and there was a bartender and 1 person sitting at the bar. So we seat ourselves at the front of the restaurant and it literally took the guy behind the bar 10 min. to finally put down some menus, he goes back to the bar chitty chatty with the guy sitting at the bar another 10 min goes by he  comes back to take the order. We order drinks and food (Sabinita-- layers of refried black beans, cheese, sour cream & guacamole, Poblanito -soft tortilla; mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds) and two Pescado- mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds). 

Slowly two of the wait staff make their way in and the guy behind the bar says something in spanish possibly about being late who knows seems to be the trend here, and then another table of patrons come in and than another the wait staff all of two seem confused and dazed. The Sabinita comes to to the table and I ask the waiter if our drinks are coming he says he doesn't know, 5 min later the rest of the order comes out I ask again about the drinks another guy comes over with a menu I said no I ordered them when I first sat down? Repeated the order ( like really the bartender couldn't remember to send out the friggin drinks when at the time there was a total of 4ppl in the place (I could just imagine if there were more than 12 ppl in this place it would be like chaos to remember OMG all these drinks OMG ....seriously its like amateure night in here).

 He comes back minutes later with the drinks, in all fairness not his fault he didn't take the order initially nor was he the  DUH guy that said didn't know when the drinks were coming, and that is the last time we saw anyone come over,no one came by to check on the table to see if everything was good ( which it was NOT) and the place was not busy 4 tables occupied does not constitute as busy.   

 The Poblanito was just ok , the fish tacos were downright dreadful they were breaded in some sort of cornmeal which  was not an issue but the fish they used had a gelatinous texture and honestly there wasn't a dash of seasoning in the coating or the fish itself  not even the toppings were seasoned. IT WAS BLAND  i could barely get through it so so i doused it with hot sauce and still it stank (tastewise) so I only ate the one left the other one on the plate and covered it with my napkin (RIP).

 So now all I have left is half a beer which i'm chugging so I can get the hell outta there!! I indicate to the waiter that we're ready to leave and the bill arrives and he asked how was it ?  I was blunt, honest said it was terrible he was concerned surprised and wanted specifics, so I went off about the fish he said he would go and let the the guy in the back know ,  I said really you don't have to but off he went came back apologised. I said I guess that is just how its done here the only redeeming thing about this whole meal was the Sabinita & the beer.

 Sad to say but  I'm not one to give 2nd chances when it comes to food & service like I said this city is a ""Food Mecca"" too many other places to go and try, so bottom line I would never venture back to this place, I would rather take my $$ and go around the corner to Barrio Coreano or Tacos El Asador where the service and food at least in my experiences have been consistently great ."
2,"My girlfriend and I visited at 5:30 on a Saturday . We luckily were able to get a seat at the bar. This is definitely that place where a reservation is needed. People were being turned away due to reserved seating. On to the food... The guacamole was amazing.. The tacos were spicy! I love spicy food and I even thought some things were spicy, especially the shrimp.Aesthetic definitely a 10/10. Cool place, wouldn't eat here again though"
2,"This place is authentic (in my non mexican opinion) and damn good. I like the creepy washrooms in the basement that add to the ""hole in the wall"" feeling of this restaurant. I think three tacos for 10$ is a good deal. The Mexican sausage and steak were delicious as they had these little pieces of juicy fat. They have different levels of spicy sauces yummm."
2,"The initial plan was to go to a nearby restaurant but got the ""we nuh have dat"". 

That said I am shocked that I have not been to Mexico Lindo before, my new benchmark for Mexican food in Scarborough. 

Clean environment, adequate space for dining in. None of the over the top decor stuff, the menu was straight forward. 

Tried their combo with Chicken chimichanga & enchiladas. Refried beans, rice, salad, and sauce !! Overall the food was flavorful, to make it simple. Portion size was good, in the addition the complimentary nachos was nice. 

Make it straight forward would recommend and would go again. Beats getting a naked burrito elsewhere, plus there is a variety of options to choose from.  

5/5"
0,"This is yet another restaurant in Chinatown which specializes in homemade dumplings and Northern Chinese cuisine. 

I came here only because Yummy Dumplings was closed for lunch on Wednesday, so I ended up here to satisfy my dumpling cravings. 

I ordered the pork & chives dumplings (boiled) which was so so. The skin was thicker than I'm used to but still acceptable & you get 16 dumplings for $7.99. The XLB soup dumplings came next. It was presented in the usual bamboo steamer and you get 10 small bite size pieces. It certainly wasn't my favourite because the skin was thick & some seemed under cooked. The pork filling was okay but the soup content wasn't very consistent. Some were not replete with soup when biting into them and overall wasn't very satisfying. Also it's typically served with some fresh ginger on the side to make your dipping sauce but they don't here. Maybe their Xian style dishes are what they are best known for but it certainly wasn't the dumplings."
1,"Been visiting this place since it was on Bloor, so I'm obviously a fan. 

The food is excellent, and continues to be so, with the exception of the guacamole. It's very smooth and soft, not chunky at all. I find it to be overly citrusy, with lack of garlic taste. Reminds me of store bought super bright green guacamole that never seems to go bad . Skip the guac, and just smash an avocado at home. Everything else I've tried here has been great (tacos, tostadas).

The service has never been amazing, but has declined significantly. On my last visit, we weren't given water until 20 minutes after we were seated. Cocktails took a whopping 30 minutes. It felt awkward and kinda embarassing to try to emphatically wave down the uninterested server. After food was brought out, we weren't checked on until, once again, I found myself waving down server for our bill.

Long story short, when I received the bill, I expressed my concern with the service. The explanation honestly pissed me off. They said the service is messed up because they have too many Uber eats orders. I told him you can't have Uber eats impacting your dine in patrons, but apparently you can. We live in a new world where restaurants can probably survive off of online orders. Either way, waiting 20 minutes for water isn't an Uber issue."
1,"I am a huge fan of Xian style Biang Biang Mein. I haven't found a place in Toronto that makes this. Therefore, when I found a picture of this dish on their ad outside I had to try it. It is strange that I could not find a yelp review. However, there were plenty of google reviews on this restaurant.

It's own by a couple and I feel they gear their restaurant to Chinese speaking customers. Their English is quite weak. I ordered the Biang Biang noodles and steam dumplings. I wrote the number down and wrote the English name on the paper. The lady had to clarify what I meant with another customer. They make their dumplings from scratch and have a pretty big menu.

I do have to admit their Biang Biang noodles and their dumplings are not the best I had. However, they are cheaper than other places around Spadina. What I did not enjoy was one of the owner/cook was clearing his throat alot during the time I was there which was very gross because you hope he did not spit on your food. Really, clearing your throat should be done in the privacy of your own home and not your business where they are customers.

The owners are nice but they are more friendly to Chinese speaking customers because they can communicate with them. If you cannot speak Chinese they will serve you but you will be ignored most of the time."
2,"Special tacos are $6, which is more expensive than I am used to spending on tacos but you are also paying for unique, higher quality tacos. We had the Baja Fish and Carnitas tacos and they were delicious. Definitely a must-try place in Toronto.

Like many places in Kensington, the place is quite small and there aren't many seats. Be prepared to either stand at their standing tables or stand outside and eat. We stood at one of the standing tables which was fine because it doesn't take long to consume their delicious tacos."
2,Best tacos I've ever had. Both locations are great and offer a great selection of Mexican fare.
0,"The service was amazing, the guy that greeted us especially was very enthusiastic. But .. when it came from the food. it was definitely 1/5. No flavour , no seasoning no nothing. We ordered 6 Tacos, Guac and chips and cheese Pupusas . To begin with the tacos lets just say we didn't eat them all. The shrimp tasted too.. fishy? not enough toppings on the taco. The beef was blend and so was the chicken. Only good thing about our order was the guac and chips. I normally go to taco Gus at Kensington (highly recommend ) and I regret trying something new."
1,"This place is a very busy spot downtown and it's the type of place you come and go or take it to go because of how tight the space is. I got the 3 type plate and they're okay. They're not bad but not amazing either (bear in mind, I eat a lot of tacos). Definitely worth trying out if you're already in the area but would I take an hr TTC ride to come here again? Nope."
1,"I was so excited to come here based on the number of reviews that said this was ""the best ramen in Toronto"". 

I was underwhelmed. The spicy red miso ramen had zero flavor and zero spice. 

Service was great and friendly. I joined the waitlist on Yelp while we were ubering from Union. By the time we got there we waited less than five minutes. 

You just put yourself on the waitlist and once you get there you check in with the host. They text you once your table is ready. Very efficient. 

But yeah. It was ok. I've had better ramen..."
1,"Dinner:
Peking Duck, 2 courses
Spicy Shrimp hot pot with vermicelli
Shrimp with black bean sauce

I had not been to Lai Wah Heen in several years, until recently.

The two course peking duck was definitely better than in a normal restaurant. I could tell that the flour wraps were of much higher quality than normal. Perhaps made fresh at the restaurant? 
They serve it with the duck, cucumber, green onion already on the wrap, then you can add the sauce on your own.
The second course was a pretty standard version of the lettuce wraps.

Spicy Shrimp Hot Pot with Vermicelli was excellent. I would order this dish again without question. The clear vermicelli noodles are a great compliment to the spicy sauce and large shrimp.

Shrimp with black bean sauce was good, but did not stick out as much.

Overall, it was a good meal, but the prices are prohibitive."
1,"I think this is between a 3 and a 4.  I enjoyed the tacos,   the chicken one was really very tasty.  But what a mess to eat,  the wrap was very soft and fell apart but it all had a wonderful taste,   lots of flavours.

I had the melted cheese starter with chorizo,  it was ok.  I personally don't like the corn wrap they make here.   They are thick and heavy and really doesn't add anything to the cheese dip.    We had the chips and dip to start with.   There was were some very nice dips here from chillies and guacamole too.   The chips are quite salty though, be warned.   We also had a tasty citrus drink,  grapefruit based,  this was very nice,  we both enjoyed this.   We ended with the churros which were very nice.  Sweet cinammon sugar on top,   very yummy. 

On the whole it was good and alright mixed together.   But also isn't cheap.   I think it cost us $70 for food and two sodas,"
1,"Went last week on Thursday to try their all you can eat Tacos. Nice hand made tortillas. I tried Beef, Carnitas, Pastor and Barbacoa. They were okish, the beef meat wasn't too good. Barbacoa was nice. Very well served with lots of meat. The salsas were in a bottle mild, medium and hot. Not very typical Mexican salsas in terms of flavour and freshness. A friend ordered a slice of Tres leches cake and something was off, the milk on it was not very good tbh so it wasn't eaten. So $19 for all you can eat, 3 tacos first and then one taco at the time. It wasn't completely bad but I doubt I will be back."
1,"Stumbled upon this restaurant while searching for lunch before heading to Yorkdale. The restaurant is quite small, more of a takeout joint and seats about 6 people. The restaurant is very hot and humid and there was only one fan facing the window. There is free street parking (depending on the time), however there is paid parking directly in front of the restaurant.

We ordered the 3 for $12 ( Black Tiger Shrimp, Fish & Carnitas tacos). The food was flavourful, however it didn't hit the spot for me. We also took advantage of the free chips and salsa check in offer.

Overall, nice presentation of the tacos but I wouldn't be going out of my way to come back to satisfy my taco cravings."
1,"Lai Wah Heen offers excellent service and good food. The prices are higher compared to restaurants in Chinatown nearby, but you are paying for better service and food. 

The service is always great here. Servers are attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is casual. Overall, I enjoy most of the items I've had here. You will not leave disappointed if you have a dinner here. The service and food are both great. 

However, I am only giving it a 3 stars because I think the prices are high for what you get. Yes, the food is better than some of the cheaper restaurants in Chinatown. However, it isn't anything exceptional to me for the price they charge. It is priced higher because it is in a great location perhaps. For the prices here, I am expecting more unique items."
2,"Came here for an early lunch wit my bf. First time in Toronto and this spot was located just around the block from our hotel. 

Pretty quiet when we first came but the music and vibe was definitely attractive. My bf and I sat upstairs which was deceptively larger than I expected. Our waiter/bartender Tahir helped us throughout our time. He was helpful, attentive, and extremely personable. He certainly represented the establishment in a positive way and provided us with great service. Gave us food and drink recommendations when asked and also provided us with additional information on things to do in town.

Food was amazing. We ordered the lunch pre-fixe menu with an additional 2 tacos lol (it was that good). Tacos are HIGHLY recommended, which seem to be their specialty. We also ordered some drinks that were made to the T!!

Certainly recommend this spot for lunch/dinner anytime in Toronto! Don't miss out on a good time."
0,"I came her few weeks ago. I straight up saw this lady (pretty sure the owner) handle cash/ scratch her head and touched the food right after. I

Of course I only had a few bites and left the rest cause I was so grossed out. When I was paying for my bill, I let her know what I saw and she started giving racist quotes. ""All the chinese places do the same thing"", and walked away.

I would have just left it and not think twice, but for them to say something like that, that is a big nono. 

McDonalds food is higher quality than this. 

DO NOT COME HERE."
2,"After hearing many phenomenal reviews about Good Hombres, and having tried its sister restaurant Campechano, I felt very much obligated and drawn to trying this place! To my knowledge, they've recently begun taking reservations, so I placed one for a Thursday night. It's quite a long, narrow joint - upon walking in, you're met with a kitchen counter / bar for takeout and quick orders. To get to the main dining room, you pass through a small doorway. The vibe is also significantly different from Campechano; it's a far more casual vibe adorned with bright, colourful paintings.

To be honest, I was on the fence between 3 and 4 stars. On the one hand, I really did enjoy the tacos and they're objectively better than most places. On the other, I enjoyed Campechano much more, but gave that place 4 stars. In terms of cost / value, both place ended up costing me roughly the same, but I found Campechano to be far more satisfying (they have a double tortilla and have heftier, more generous fillings).

We ordered 10 tacos (for $3.95) each. I got the pescado (fish / haddock), champinones (mushrooms), camaron (shrimp) for my first round. For my second, I got a second pescado and added the barbacoa (lamb leg). My boyfriend got the carnitas (confit pork shoulder), pastor (pork butt), and barbacoa. For his second round, he got double carnitas - he just loved it that much!

Carnitas & Barbacoa
These tacos tasted identical to the ones I had at Campechano, so my review remains unchanged. The carnitas, being cooked in its own fat, is a very rich and hearty concoction. There's no real acidity, apart from the lime, to balance out the flavours - as such, it's a very pure, meaty delight. The barbacoa is seasoned and has more spices, and the meat is less 'tender and soft' compared to the pork (though objectively still very tender).

Pastor
The pork butt is definitely tougher and drier than the other meats, but still super flavourful. I particularly liked the addition of the pineapples - while it threw me off initially, I found that the fruitiness helped balance the textures and flavours. 

Pescado
There was a good chunk of fried haddock on the taco, topped with some pickles and spicy chipotle mayo. It was delicious - and so lightly battered! The flavour is a bit more muted than the meat tacos, but so satisfying. 

Champinones
This was the weakest one, I found - but still super fragrant and umami. The mushrooms didn't go as well with the tacos as the other options, but it's still very flavourful and far better than the poblano peppers I had at Campechano last time.

Camaron
I personally found this taco a bit difficult to eat; the small pieces of deep fried, brown shrimp bits often crumbled and threaten to cascade on my plate. That said, the flavours were delicious! I found them somewhat similar to the pescado (likely attributed to the common denominator of chipotle mayo), but the flavours were far richer and heartier. Definitely my favourite - and this is a slightly 'pricier' (though nonetheless not expensive) taco at $4.25. Well worth it!

Overall, I did thoroughly enjoy Good Hombres. The tacos are smaller than those at Campechano (maybe ~60% of the size?) but the flavours are the same. The service and ambiance is good. It's likely a nature of the tacos I chose (fish and shrimp), but I found there to be too much chipotle mayo. That said, I would definitely come again, and cannot wait for the opening of their third store!"
1,"Going to start off this review by saying the food was great. Our table ordered the Caesar salad, gnocchi ragu, lobster pasta, and tagliolini con funghi. Wonderful food. 

Why the 3 stars? Boy, did we have the most annoyingly cocky/rude/ignorant waiter?! This customer service experience was so frustrating that it warranted a Yelp review. 
Upon entering the restaurant, everyone from the host to the bartenders had been amazing. We came on a busy night and we had no reservations, and the host had us seated at the bar while he scrambled to get us a table for 6. The bartender was great company, and we enjoyed our cocktails while waiting for a table. 
Of course once we were seated, we got stuck with this sarcastic douche bag of an employee... suddenly regretted choosing this restaurant just because of this dude. He made a lot of rude comments, maybe he thought he was funny? Somehow the conversation with him had eventually evolved into him reminiscing about getting 'so f**ked up one time' while our family was trying to enjoy our dinner. That was just the icing on the cake. 

The food did actually take a bit long to come out. We had waited a good half hour after ordering. 

If you can tolerate the company of some really rude and (not funny) sarcastic waiters, then I do recommend trying the food here. Otherwise, there are better places to spend $30-50 per person on dinner that will guarantee better service. Hopefully if you do go, you get a better server."
1,"I guess I'm becoming more health-conscious, but after loading up on carbohydrates in the form of noodles, I didn't feel great afterwards. The noodles themselves are a step above your ordinary noodles, I have to admit. They do a good job in the noddles department, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I ate something that wasn't beneficial for my health or my body. That place was packed on a Friday evening, so I'm guessing it's pretty popular and has a loyal clientele. Despite good service, I probably won't be coming back as my diet and food preferences are slowly shifting toward healthy & nutritious food that good for my body. Everyone has to make their own choice. After all, you are what you eat. Food is medicine if you eat the right food."
2,"For those looking for a more authentic Mexican meal in central TO, this is a great option! Decided to stop in here with a girlfriend for a late lunch and we were happy we did! We started with guc n chips which are a a must with any Mexican meal if you ask me. While the guc was fresh, it was missing salt and the chips didn't appear to be made in house which would have both lead to a 5 versus 4 star rating. I had never had beef tongue tacos so I had to give those a try, especially since my girlfriend who is Spanish highly recommend them and so did the server. Two sauces were offered to add to the tacos and those mixed together tasted excellent! No tongue taste haha :)
We also ordered Margaritas which were terrific! 
Service was friendly and fast. The prices were also great. I'll recommend the spot and would definitely return."
2,"Came here for a quick lunch during work hours. Overall, tacos were good, but I felt the tortillas were a little dough-y. I ordered chorizo, fish, pulled pork, and I forgot what the last one was. If you're in the area and craving for some Mexican tacos, give this place a try. They accept all payments and heads up, seating is very limited."
0,"I added this to my list based on good Yelp reviews. We ordered a takeaway - burrito, quesadilla and corn chips. Overall the food was not fresh, the burrito was average and quesadilla lacked any flavor. Corn chips were overly salty and guac was not fresh. I will try again..."
2,First time trying authentic Mexican food. Place is located in a small rundown plaza at Birchmount & Huntingwood. Staff is friendly and good service! I ordered Mexican Chicken & Beef Enchiladas with rice/salad. I forgot to take picture . Love the food ! Will definitely go back to try other dishes.
1,"Mi Taco Taqueria is a festive bright takeout/sit down place to grab a couple tacos and a drink. You order at the cashier and they give you a number so that you can seat yourself during the wait. They have a colorful seating area in the back, with interesting lights and banners to envoke a festive charm to the small space.

We ordered the guac and chips, and 6 tacos. The guac is on the small side but tastes fresh with plenty of herbs and bright flavors. Between the 6 tacos that we had, I prefered the carnitas and the sliced beef tacos the most. The flavoring was the most interesting, while the others were okay but at times a little bland. At $5-6 a peice, the tacos are not cheap but it can be expected due to the popular location."
2,"Nice little spot for a casual lunch with friends! Lots of different options for tacos, and the ones I tried were delicious!"
2,"Came here before during my visit in Toronto and really enjoyed this place. There isn't much room to sit or eat, but they give you sauces and likes for your tacos. 
Food -
Cabeza : very tender meat and lots of sauce. Would definitely get it again.
The fish taco I had here was very good as well. 
The prices here are a little much but the quality of the food makes up for it. Definitely worth coming for a bite."
1,"My group and I came here to celebrate a birthday. There were issues with the reservation, as they had only called to confirm the day of the event, and we found we weren't being treated appropriately because of it by the hostess/first waiter upstairs that we received. It also may have been because of young age compared to the rest of their customers. If you plan to visit, make reservations and make sure there are no miscommunications before arriving. 

They ended up being able to accommodate us and our new waiter downstairs was very friendly and helpful. Despite the service in the beginning, it was quickly turned around with good service and great food. I ordered the gnocchi and it was delicious and filling. 

This place felt more like a date spot than a spot for large parties, there are a few floors, but it's still small. The food would be 5/5 for me but with the initial service, had to give it a 3."
2,"I decided to check this place out during my never ending taco obsession phase. The patio looks pretty with twinkling lights and a mini fire pit on one of the middle tables. I came on 2 separate occasions & Chula did not disappoint! Both times I had the fried calamari appetizer, shrimp, fish & chicken tacos. The amount of food was filling because usually I could probably eat like 8 tacos and still be hungry. I'm not a fan of the location so I wouldn't go out of my way to visit, but I'd definitely come back if I were in the area. 

Tip: Try to secure the spot with the mini fire table

2,"Super friendly staff, if i could give it ten stars I would. Amazing food great atmosphere. There isn't a bad thing I could say about this place one of my favourite restaurants!"
1,"Terrific food, poor atmosphere, great customer service.  They deliver and are open during covid!"
2,"Knowing where to get the best tacos in town is serious business. As it stands, the best tacos that I have ever eaten have been at Tacofino in Tofino and Tres Carnales Taquer√≠a in Edmonton. After reading that Seven Lives was voted #1 Best Taco 2018 by NOW Toronto, named in National Geographic magazine's Places of a Lifetime article, and called #1 Best Fish Taco and #1 Best Tacos by blogTO... They seemed like a sure bet.

You'll find Seven Lives located in Kensington Market, one of the most eclectic corners of the city which suits them well. I visited the tiny shop on a Friday evening, prior to their early closing time of 7pm. They're definitely more of a lunch or early dinner type of place. It should also be noted that they accept cash only, so come prepared!

The tiny shop is bustling and exciting, buzzing with taco energy. The bright walls and giant sign that reads ""TACOS"" sets the vibe perfectly. I also appreciate their logo of a cat with a fish in its mouth - and the insinuation that this cat is down to seven lives, having already lost two. There is one table that can seat about four people and then there's a little bit of standing-room-only counter space. This makes things a little bit awkward if you plan to eat-in, as I did. The table wasn't available and so I stood at the counter in front of the window to eat instead. Which was fine. But certainly not ideal.

The menu is fairly straight forward, including nine types of tacos, some sides, and some beverages. Your order is placed at the counter with a friendly staff member and they call out your name once the food is ready.

Starting with something to drink, I was happy to see Agua de Jamaica on the menu. I always prefer an agua fresca when visiting a Mexican establishment, although I was also happy to see that Jarritos Mexican sodas are also on offer. (Their cola is my personal favourite of all of the colas.) Agua de Jamaica, otherwise known as ""hibiscus water"" is a beverage that exists in several cultures. In Southeast Asia it is known as Rosella tea and it's basically the same thing. Tart and sweet, this refreshing drink was a perfect accompaniment to the food.

We decided to get a Side as a bit of an appetizer. Tortilla Chips (Made fresh! - $3.00) and Guacamole ($3.00 for small) seemed like the way to go. I was a bit surprised that the guacamole didn't just come with tortilla chips and that both items had to be purchased separately. However, I did enjoy the homemade nature of the chips and that a heaping amount of them are tossed into a brown paper bag and given to you. I'll take a bag of chips any day. Golden and ultra crispy, these tortilla chips are exactly what I wanted them to be. They were seasoned really nicely as well. The guacamole was fresh and bright, with a great acidic kick to it. Obviously chips and guac are a match made in heaven.

Next it was time for the big show: the TACOS. Of the nine tacos available, two of them (the Adobada and the Carnitas) were already sold out. On the plus side, I probably wouldn't have ordered either of these anyway. Although, I must say that this did not leave much for meat options. There were four fish/seafood tacos, one beef and one chicken option, and a vegetarian. Nothing for pork at all. But again, I did not mind at all because I was going full ocean food - it's what they specialize in, after all.

Baja Fish ($6.00) and Gobernador ($6.00) were the ones for me. I loved the little condiments bar to the left of the counter that featured three different salsas (hot habanero, medium tomatillo, mild guajillo) as well as chili oil with sesame, and a bowl of sliced limes. This makes it very easy to customize your tacos to your preferred specifications and to control the amount of heat that you desire.

The tacos did not take very long and before I knew it, a green plastic basket was placed in my hands. The tacos were certainly vibrant and demanding to be eaten.

I began with the Gobernador (smoked marlin, shrimp & cheese). If Seven Lives has a signature taco, this is the one. Their front window even says ""home of the Gobernador"" right on it. I definitely loved the smokiness from the marlin the most, while the shrimp filled out the taco and added more texture. Everything had been grilled up deliciously. The pickled onion brought a great hit of balancing flavour and I liked the fresh tortillas a lot.

Next I had the Baja Fish (fried haddock). The first thing that I noticed is how generous the portion of fish is! The haddock was big, juicy and fried to perfection. The rest of the taco was kept very fresh with cabbage and fresh homemade salsa on top.

Both tacos were packed full and were pretty messy to eat, but in the best possible way. I liked both tacos but found them to be missing something that I can't quite put my finger on. I guess that I was hoping for something even bigger and more unexpected in terms of flavour. They were good... Just not the best that I've ever had.

I was also very impressed to see a C"
2,"This was a great gem, worth the drive if you crave some authentic tacos!

I was a bit surprised to find this well run taco joint amongst all Korean restaurants but it really works!

Lots of bench style seating easily fits 4, but gets squishy as this place fills up at lunch time. The service is quick, the food came fast and hot and for tacos, quesadilla, burrito type foods, but our pupusa came after tacos, maybe cuz of table room? Cuz they certainly not a dessert dish. 

The warm corn wraps were so so good, guacamole was fresh and the perfect green and texture. I had to try one fish and one shrimp taco with a squash pupusa(pan fried puffy corn tortilla pancake like thing? served with a pickled cabbage slaw and hot sauce salsa) and was ok full but ordered another shrimp taco just in case 

Easily you can start lunch less than $4, but really takes 3-4 tacos for a good lunch which run closer to $15, they have good combos for certain days which is nice and take out was very popular while we were here. My girlfriends all agreed the fish was best of the tacos, and would easily come back tomorrow after our seminar."
1,"My friends and I (6+ people) came on a Tuesday for the Tuesday special where you get 8 hardshell tacos to share. My friends ordered the other tacos and really liked the 'In Cod We Trust' taco. We also had quesadillas, corn, and churros (really delicious btw, I highly recommend). I also ordered a cocktail and was surprised at the alcohol content, despite the small portion. Overall, I found the food to be really tasty and well seasoned! I just found the portion sizes to be quite small for the prices they were charging.

Our server did a great job on checking up on us and keeping up with our orders. We would occassionally just blurt out to add another item and I was impressed that they remembered it all- thank you!! Our server was also quite engaging, which made this place very welcoming and down to earth. 

The interior is decorated quite nicely and this place is very hipster. I would also recommend booking a table because, despite the numerous amounts of tables, quite a lot of them were reserved. There is also a bar for people who want to pop by for drinks only. 

The food came at a timely manner and the place was quite comfy. We were decently full but the prices really weren't worth the portion sizes we were given. This knocked back a few stars for me. Also, the bill could not be separated so figuring that out with a large group was not so favorable. Being a large group, we were not notified about the automatic gratuity until we asked for the bill at the end."
2,"TLDR: Generally, La Carnita is a solid pick for Mexican food if you're in the area and there is no wait. Good Mexican food, not the best in Toronto but a solid choice.

True review: 3.5/5

Atmostphere: I've been here a few times, but quite honestly I've skipped it for the past few years. This is just due to the wait times - there isn't always a wait, but if I'm going to wait for tacos it'll probably not be here. The atmosphere is very dark, which isn't my favourite but otherwise a cozy/industrial look.

Food: 
Overall I'd recommend a shared appetizer and two or three tacos per person depending on your appetite. I myself opted for two. 

1) Chips and dip: This was good! The three dips were great, and it's nice to have a choice. 
2) In cod we trust: This was definitely popular amongst those dining with me. The presentation is good, a bit sauce heavy but overall good.
3) Carne asada taco: Overall good flavours, nothing groundbreaking but no complaints either! 
4) Tuna ceviche tostada: This has consistently been my favourite - good flavours on a cripsy tostada. Definitely recommend!"
2,"Campechano is a great place for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. Their menu contains options for both and items are sold by piece, so everyone can order whatever they want.

Most tables start with the guacamole ($8) where it arrives with two cups brimming with thin crispy chips, which they refill if you finish the tortilla before the dips. The salsa roja is great, with just a bit of spice and plenty of zest. It leaves the guacamole feeling fairly neutral, jazzed up with pomegranate - an interesting twist, though personally I do enjoy my dip without fruit.

If you're feeling hungry than order a sencillo sopes ($6) for yourself; otherwise, it's hearty enough to share. The tortilla is thicker and soft, almost like naan but not oily. A layer of refried beans is spread on top with lettuce, cheese, and two types of sauce covering the pillowy tortilla. A different alternative to Campechano's tacos, but not nearly as exciting.

If you can handle spice, the hongo ahumado ($6) has a healthy kick of fiery sauce drizzled on top. This heat was unexpected as the taco's description made it sound earthy tasting, from the smoked mushroom base, with a hearty finish, thanks to the white bean puree. In reality, aside from the spice, it's rather fresh with plenty of herbs sprinkled over top and very tasty, despite all the water you'll have afterwards.

On the other hand, the healthy sprinkling of cotija cheese on the rajas ($5) makes the roasted poblano peppers taco richer than you'd expect. Additionally, the peppers aren't spicy at all, instead having a deep earthiness. With little bits of corn added for bite, this was another tasty taco.

Campechano's dining room is small and cozy, so try to make a reservation. Regardless, there seems to be plenty of walk-ins and on our weekday dinner visit, the wait wasn't long... their service is friendly and efficient so most tables turn over quickly."
2,"One of my fave Mexican places in Toronto. Food and drinks are great and it's a fun vibe. 

Definitely order the Mexican corn to start off with, its delicious and big enough to share. My favourite tacos are the fried chicken with peanut sauce (I believe the pollo frito), the baja shrimp tacos and the carne asada. Three tacos usually fill me up. 

Great to place to eat and hang out, just find the music a bit loud to have a proper convo, but will be coming back here regardless!"
0,"New owner!!
Was my favourite place in the hood but noticed that the owner ship has changed and quality of the food has deteriorated. 
Less food and high priced."
2,"I've been looking all over town for the most authentic taquer√≠a in Toronto, and think I've finally found it. Campechano had a great patio, hearty tacos, great corn tortillas, and a solid margarita.

Pastor - definitely one of my new favourite tacos in Toronto. The meat was well marinated, had a strong spicy kick (a little spicier than I expected tbh but not too much) and the sweet acidic pineapple complimented it perfectly.

Campechano - the meat in this one was incredibly juicy and well cooked, and the sauces were nice and light, unlike many places where it can be an overbearing addition to a dish. 

Overall I would definitely come back here, order both the tacos again, and I can't wait to try more of them."
1,"Food is good, we were craving dumplings and we came to the right place. Got a variety of steamed & pan fried dumplings. Food comes pretty quickly but I wished the place was a bit cleaner. The plastic soup spoon was stained from overuse, the condiments were obviously neve really cleaned well everyday. The worst of it though was when we went to pay the bill the lady demanded we add +$2 for tip. I have never been to a restaurant that has said that to me."
1,"I came here to try out some tacos.  The tacos average in price about $5 each.  They have different sauces that you can put on your tacos.   I tried the pork tacos.  While it wasn't bad, it wasn't memorable either.  

This place is located inside and there are other businesses inside as well.  It was hot and stuffy.  The restaurant wasn't the cleanest either.  

Overall, it was just ok.  A bit cheaper than the more famous place across the street."
1,"House of Gourmet is a great spot for late night Chinese food with huge portion at reasonable price! However, don't expect anything extraordinary because you get what you pay for. 

On all of my visits, even ones at 2AM, the place was constantly busy so service always seemed so rushed. The restaurant offers a several options of typical Chinese dishes such as dumplings, fried noodles/rice, soup, etc. My go-to is definitely seafood congee! It is cooked to just the right consistency, not too watery or too thick. Seafood includes shrimp, fish fillet, abalone, scallop, squid and small pieces of ginger that really brings out the flavor! The portion for a small congee is super filling that will likely keep you full until the next meal. I've also tried their noodles soup with BBQ duck & BBQ a few times but it was meh. One time I'd find the broth to be too bland, and other times it was so salty. Other than that, the noodles also comes with generous amount at decent price.

Overall, House of Gourmet is definitely a good choice for late night food, but the quality doesn't really stand out from other restaurants."
0,"Sweet and sour soup was good. Dumplings were good.  Our meals were bleh. Had Tsao chicken, which looked very nice but was more deep fried pieces than chunks of chicken.  My spouse had chicken with ginger and scallions which he enjoyed. A friend had some beef dish that was indescribable."
2,"Amazing!! Family run, authentic, delicious food, competitive pricing and great portions! Love that they offer courtesy chips and homemade salsa! They earned our business and we will definitely be returning. Mexitaco has lost our business. Overpriced and portions are a rip off. This is way better! You won't regret it!"
1,Came here for lunch with group of friends. Service was good and attentive. Food portion is small for the price. Finished the spaghetti meatballs and was still hungry. Probably will not come back.
2,"Ordered for the first time but I've heard so many great things about this place...
WOW
The portions are huge! Very hearty and fresh.
Everything stayed perfectly hot and ready.

The chicken was so tender and flavourful. 

I'll definitely have to get other things from the menu!"
1,"Food: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Decor: 3/5
Price: 4/5

Small and quaint. When entering there was a sign warning about bugs that may look like cockroaches inside the restaurant. It says to not be alarmed they are not cockroaches and it is natural during the summer days for these little insects to find their way indoors. If spotted you can call a waiter to come by and they will sweep them up and take them outdoors. 

The menu's are suuuuper dirty. They do not wipe them down at all! There's tons of grit and its sticky on all 3 of our menu's. The pricing wasn't too clearly shown. For the main's its all the same price located at the very top $16.95 and then you can add on your different meats for a dollar or 2 on top. 

We got two appetizers the garlic shrimp and the fried chicken. They were both delicious!. For the mains the green curry was okay, we got it with beef. Big mistake, their beef is extremely tough! it was super dry, felt like it's been cooked for days and kept in the fridge to be warmed up in a microwave and tossed into the curry to serve. The 3 flavours pad thai was good. had a lot of flavour and ingredients as well. The best out of the 3 was the Khao Soi, i got that one with chicken. Delicious. No complaints. 

We let the waitress know about the really tough beef and she just took the dish and brought it to the kitchen without saying a word. After a few minutes she came back and said she would switch the curry to chicken instead. We agreed and she took the plate back inside. It was a pretty busy night so taking awhile for the food to come out is understandable. I shared the Khao Soi and waited for the green curry to come out. By the time we finished our food it finally came. We just asked for it to-go. 

The service i would say is about a 3.5, she seemed as though she was just rushing through everything without talking with the customers. Food took quite a while as well. I would go back to try their other menu items."
2,"Campechano Taqueria is tucked away inconspicuously at the corner of Adelaide/Portland. Inside you'll find a quiet, mellow and hip taqueria that makes for a great date spot or catch-up dinner with friends. I'd say that Campechano is distinct from other popular taquerias nearby such as Wilbur and Mi Taco in that it is a lot more of a sit-down place and not so much a take-out or eat-and-go type of place, so if you're looking for more of that vibe, Campechano is definitely for you.

Campechano's tacos are noticeably pricier than other taquieras nearby, and although tasty, I honestly found it hard to justify the extra cost. My buddy and I went for a taco crawl and we went to the two aforementioned taquerias and we both agreed that Campechano's tacos left quite a bit to be desired as the last taqueria in our crawl. Although most of the tacos come with avocado, which is often a premium ingredient, the meats were a bit too salty for our taste. I would even say that the barbacoa, made with braised lamb, was a little bit too chewey for my liking. Nonetheless, Campechano serves delicious tacos and provides a unique atmosphere and dining experience so it is definitely worth going to."
2,"Como En Casa is a cheap and cheerful place to get a spicy lunch or supper fix. Recently, I enjoyed a three taco meal with beans and rice. It was filling, tasty and hit the spot. Nothing mind blowing here, but it's delicious no frills Mexican. Bonus points for being on Uber Eats."
1,"Spice levels were a bit all over the place. The curry was spicier than the pad thai and chicken kua gling, even though we ordered it with less spice than the others. 

The Thai iced tea was pretty good. Started out a bit syrupy but was perfect once the ice started melting."
1,"Short and Sweet: 
The food was delicious, but the service was lacking. 

Long Story... Long: 
My friend and I both got the grilled calamari. It was delicious and well made. The calamari was a generous portion that fit the price.

The service, however, ruined my visit a bit. We had multiple different waiters, which was confusing. The one towards the end, who had given us our bill was kind and attentive, but the others were rushed, asked the same questions/clarifications multiple times, and generally felt uncomfortable.

I had asked for a balsamic reduction sauce for my order, if possible. I was told that it was, and the waiter came back with what looked like olive oil and balsamic vinegar together in a small container, which can actually be found on our table. I thought, ""this is not what I meant, but no problem."" I got charged 3 extra dollars for this, which I was both unaware of and unhappy about. Apparently they had added truffle oil, which in my experience is distinct and I can normally tell, but I could not in this instance. This is also where the added price came from.

I would have preferred being warned that there would be an extra charge and that they couldn't do the balsamic reduction sauce in the first place.

Otherwise, I did really like the dish, but the overall experience makes me want to pick another restaurant in the Yorkville area."
2,"Went last week. Food is very good! Churros were amazing  and drinks are made with fair amount of alcohol compared to other places. Friendly staff! Would recommended! Make sure to make reservations as it is a very very cozy place. Unless you don't mind sitting at the bar, as I did."
2,"This place is HOT as fire! Oh i mean it is soooo good. The interiors are where i should begin at. Stunning yet very simple. Seating at every corner is differently setup yet classy. 

The bar area is also very good.. since we had to wait for the table the server offered us to seat at the bar as the wait time was 45mins. 

The seats were so comfortable and also you can order any food on the menu to the bar area which is even better.. the tacos were fresh and tasty! Ordered fish and chicken 

Not to forget, they also have a 3-4 table patio"
0,"I came last summer and had an amazing dinner, I remembered the tacos to be rich in flavour and super affordable which was a big stand out to me since a lot of other taco places that charge upwards of $7/8 per taco. I dare to say that this WAS my favourite taco place at the time.

I came back this month for the first time in nearly a year and things were a lot different. For Tacos, I ordered the Biztec de Carne and the Carnita and they ended up tasting exactly the same, which was disappointing and weird since they have a lot of different ingredients altogether. Also there seemed to be a lot of liquid in the taco filling because halfway through eating one of my tacos it fell apart due to the moisture. Also, in all of the tacos, there seemed to be this weird crunchy/salty/sweet ingredient that I couldn't tell what it was. It was really odd, and gave the tacos a weird flavour/texture profile. This was not the same as what I ate a year ago, and they seemed to be more expensive than I remembered.

The one thing that stayed consistent however was their amazing Churro Sundae - everyone in the restaurant seemed to be ordering this. Their Churros were seasoned and cooked perfectly, and the caramel ice cream pairs perfectly - its one of the best churro desserts in the city in my opinion, and would come back just for this."
1,"Good for assisting in the time of need.....HANGOVERS.

These guys are open and you can order before 4pm unlike some nasty places who don't care about my suffering.

The food is very reasonably priced and pretty good too, a usual is the beef in black bean sauce which is solid and very filling...on the other hand the fried rice dishes are not the greatest and can lack a lot of flavor.

Good place just be sure what your ordering is something powerful in flavor as the more subtle options generally tend to fail."
1,"Enoteca is a nice spot with great drinks and great vibe to grab a bite and hang out with friends. I've driven by Enoteca a number of times and finally had the time to go check this place out. Located just west of Dundas and Dovercourt, you can't miss the massive doors. 

Service was great from start to finish, attentive and overall a good experience. However, the food was decent at best. The Cacio e Pepe was on the saltier side, so be ready for that. It was very rich in flavour, a pinch less of salt and this would be been wonderful. The charcuterie board was decent, although I must say that the cheese was really good. 

Best dish of the night goes to the arancini balls. Really nice and crispy on the outside, stringy and warm cheese on the inside. Drench it in the tomato sauce, you won't regret it."
2,"Cozy little authentic Mexican restaurant. There was a quick five minute wait before we were seated. The restaurant was packed, but the service was quick, friendly and the tacos were delicious!"
0,"We came here (King St location) Tuesday evening to take our guests from Vancouver to a nice dinner. Buca has been my favorite Italian spots in Toronto and has been my top recommendation for good restaurants in the city. We never once had a negative experience at Buca until last night. It was very disappointing to be in such a classy restaurant only to be treated poorly by their servers. We ordered charcuterie and pasta amongst the 5 of us. As we finished our dinner, we had told our server to pack up my bigoli pasta. As I picked up my takeout box, I realized it was not what I ordered. I quickly told the server that this was not mine and to my surprise, she yelled ""f*** off"" and stormed off in the kitchen. We were in shock as to why she responded this way. She returned shortly after, visibly disgruntled, and told me to stay put while the manager comes to talk to me. The manager arrives and simply tells me to wait while they make a new one for me to take home. She was not apologetic at all. Mind you, we had to wait 30 minutes for them to make the pasta again and as soon as I received it, they did not even acknowledge the fact that it shouldn't have taken that long. 

Mistakes happen but under no circumstances should servers be swearing at their customers. We are extremely confused as to what led to such aggresive remarks when we were the ones who had to wait 30 minutes to get our takeout. Definitely not going back after this incident. Servers were rude and ruined our evening."
2,"Came here for a quick dinner after work with my girlfriend and we were pleasantly surprised with the food!

You order your food at the counter and they bring the food to your table. 

We got a quesadilla and a taco dinner plate. The price for the amount of food you get was great, especially in downtown! 

The workers were very friendly and happy to answer any questions we had about the menu. Our food was better than what expected and met our Mexican food cravings! Definitely will come again!"
2,"This place is never open when we want to go - they take a small break in the middle of the day and close, and that's always when we've been in the area. (I personally hate when restaurants do this, and prefer either they are open straight through or take a long break dividing lunch and dinner..that's a discussion for another day) Finally we made it one Saturday! They are also closed Sundays ...

Place was empty when we walked in but within literally five minutes it was completely full. We shared the haddock, pork w pineapple and asked for recommendation for the third taco and the cashier suggested shredded chicken. I asked for no cilantro which was respected. Quesadillas weren't available which was disappointing. 

Seating is all bar style/backless - not a problem for me yet but may turn out to be as I become a larger-pregnant person. The tacos were a good size and worked well for sharing. they all had the same sauce on top so the flavour profiles weren't extremely varied. I found the additional toppings in the tacos a little boring - it was mostly meat, tortilla (which was quite good) and the sauce - for instance the haddock could have used a tangy addition besides the small lime wedge.

I would have given this three stars but hubby gave it five, so in Yelp fairness I averaged our experience out."
1,"Rating: 3/5

Summary: 
We believe this restaurant is worth a visit if in the area. We have frequented this place multiple times and there is a reason we keep coming back. The service is extremely friendly and the atmosphere, though tight, is rather warm and welcoming. However, one must be careful when picking their dish because while some taste wonderfully flavorful, others are somewhat disappointing.

The dishes we tried: 
- burrito w/ verde sauce
- fish tacos
- chicken enchiladas
- chicken mole
- guac/salsa w/ chips
- mains circa $12-15
- appetizers circa $6-8

Food:
One of our favorite dishes is the Burrito with Verde Sauce. It's a big hot burrito packed with many flavors. What makes it special, however, is the verde sauce that complements the burrito very well. The verde sauce is a tangy and spicy sauce that consists of tomatillos, jalapenos, and lime. You probably won't get burritos smothered with a delicious sauce at other places where you'd think of getting a burrito (Chipotle, etc.). We'd also point out that the Guacamole tastes extremely fresh with a great rich and creamy feel. The chunky and spicy salsa is also great. The two dipping sauces pair well with the tortilla chips and is worth considering if looking for an appetizer.

However, we were disappointed with some of the dishes we ordered. For example, the enchiladas and chicken mole did not satisfy at all. As for the enchiladas, the ones we had were filled with extremely dry chicken and the wrap itself was also unappetizing.

On a positive note, the service is remarkable. The owner once even gave us a free refill for our horchata (a most delightful sweet drink consisting of rice, vanilla, and cinnamon). The servers are very kind and patient, thus contributing to a better dining experience.

Conclusion: 
Google reviews rates this as a 4.5/5. We give it a 3/5. It's worth a visit if in the area, but there are only certain dishes worth eating. We recommend the chicken or burrito with verde sauce and the horchata.

2,"I heard about this place and have been putting off trying it. Then I watched Ugly Delicious S1 S2 and HAD to have tacos! Dropped in and ordered 5 al pastor tacos to go and boy, I was not disappointed! Reminded me of being back in Mexico eating street tacos! So delicious! Highly recommended! Couldn't stop eating long enough to take pics lol! I'll be back!"
1,"What did I just eat? lol
I tried their Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian. It's a random mix of everything. It has a lot of vegetables (potato, mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, egg & tomato) if you want a healthier option. For me, it's not a lot of meat, a smaller portion and not very filling. The hand pulled noodles were good, the right texture, but again not enough quantity."
1,"One cold winter afternoon... hungry... cold... wandering mindlessly downtown, I stumbled upon Zhang's Kitchen tucked in the southern side of Elm Street. 

The restaurant itself is not big and I arrived late afternoon. An eerie quietness besets the restaurant. After settling down they started putting on some mandarin pop songs and handed over water and the paper menu.  Service was courteous and efficient. 

Menu wise is extremely limited here, they specialize in yellow braised dishes.  I chose yellow braised chicken with thick noodles; a fine choice for a frigid day. The sauce that was reduced and used to braised the chicken was excellent. The simple flavours created by the cooking wine, ginger, scallion, leek, and other ingredients was delicious and would warm any stomach or heart.  The chicken was equally done well. The chicken was fall off the bones texture (even though their chicken was bone-less) without giving any feeling of it being overcooked. 

What prompted a less than four star when everything sounded great? A few things... first the noodles lacked texture. They were pretty limp and felt like overcooked store bought versions. The mushroom that was added to the dish were the wet variety and the flavour of the mushroom failed to transfer to the sauce. They also added strings of green pepper on top of the dish for aesthetic purposes. This may be a personal thing but I hate when green peppers become fully cooked (while not having been grilled). 

Overall score for Zhang's Kitchen is a solid 3.4. Unless they work on their noodles, you may want to stick with rice."
